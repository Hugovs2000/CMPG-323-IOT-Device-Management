# CMPG 323 Project 3 IOT-Device-Management - 31586872
This repository contains the code for the Web App implemented with the Tier 2 Repository Pattern.

## Branching Strategy:
A development branch was used to edit project without affecting the main branch. The main and development branch was then merged when the project was completed.

## .gitignore File Uses:
The gitignore file was used to ignore the appsettings json file to keep the conncection string secure. If a different user wants to use the code, they need to add an appsettings.json file with their own connection string to their database.
